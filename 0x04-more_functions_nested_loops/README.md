Functions are a fundamental concept in C programming. They are used to group related statements together and perform a specific task. Functions can be called from other parts of the program, which makes them reusable and modular.

Nested loops are loops that are placed inside other loops. They are used when you need to perform a task multiple times, with each iteration of the outer loop triggering a new iteration of the inner loop. Nested loops can be used to iterate over two-dimensional arrays or to perform complex calculations.
