Recursion is a programming technique that involves a function calling itself to solve a problem. Recursive functions are typically used when the problem being solved can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are similar in nature to the original problem.

When a recursive function is called, it first checks if the problem is small enough to be solved without recursion, known as the base case. If the base case is not met, the function calls itself with a smaller version of the original problem until the base case is eventually met.

Recursion can be used to solve a wide range of problems, such as tree and graph traversal, searching and sorting algorithms, and mathematical calculations. It can make code more concise and easier to understand in some cases, but it can also be less efficient than non-recursive solutions due to the overhead of function calls.

It's important to be careful when using recursion, as a mistake in the base case or recursive call can lead to infinite recursion and cause the program to crash. Proper termination conditions and an understanding of how the recursive function works are crucial to using recursion effectively.

In summary, recursion is a powerful tool in programming that can be used to solve a variety of problems. By breaking down complex problems into smaller subproblems and using recursion to solve them, we can often write more elegant and efficient code. However, it's important to understand how recursion works and to use it with care to avoid errors and inefficiencies.
