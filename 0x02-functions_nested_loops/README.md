Functions:
Functions are a fundamental building block in programming that allow you to group a set of related statements together and give them a name. Functions are defined using the function keyword followed by the name of the function, a set of parentheses, and a set of curly braces that contain the statements to be executed when the function is called. Functions can take parameters (values that are passed into the function when it is called) and can return a value to the calling code. Functions are a powerful tool for organizing and modularizing code, making it easier to read, debug, and maintain.

Nested Loops:
Nested loops are loops that are defined inside of other loops. The inner loop is executed once for each iteration of the outer loop. This allows you to perform more complex operations on your data by breaking it down into smaller pieces. Nested loops can be used to traverse multi-dimensional arrays or to perform operations on sets of related data. However, you should be careful when using nested loops because they can be computationally expensive, especially if you are iterating over large amounts of data. It's important to understand the performance implications of using nested loops and to consider alternative approaches when appropriate.
